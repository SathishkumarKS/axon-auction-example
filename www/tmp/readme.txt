This is a short example how to re-create all views (=queries) in an application using 
the EventStoreManagement. It's a small part of the "Meta CQRS" project that's not published yet.
It's NOT executable and will NOT compile! It's just a small source example how to do something like 
that with the Axon Framework and some custom annotations.
