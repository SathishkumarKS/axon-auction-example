The application isn't complete yet in any way, but...

You can run a test method and trace the commands and queries:

 # Check out all projects from the SVN trunk
 # Build the projects with Maven using the [http://code.google.com/p/axon-auction-example/source/browse/#svn/trunk/auction-root auction-root] project
 # Start the local ActiveMQ, DerbyDB and SMTP Server using [http://code.google.com/p/axon-auction-example/source/browse/trunk/auction-infrastructure/src/main/java/org/fuin/auction/infrastructure/InfrastructureStart.java InfrastructureStart] class - If you use Eclipse you can use this [http://code.google.com/p/axon-auction-example/source/browse/trunk/auction-infrastructure/Start+Auction+Infrastructure.launch launch configuration]
 # Start the [http://code.google.com/p/axon-auction-example/source/browse/trunk/#trunk/auction-command-server Command Server] and [http://code.google.com/p/axon-auction-example/source/browse/trunk/#trunk/auction-query-server Query Server] web applications (using Tomcat 6 for example)
 # Run the [http://code.google.com/p/axon-auction-example/source/browse/trunk/auction-client-test/src/test/java/org/fuin/auction/client/test/CategoryUseCaseTest.java Category Test]
 # Don't forget to shutdown the local ActiveMQ, DerbyDB and SMTP Server using [http://code.google.com/p/axon-auction-example/source/browse/trunk/auction-infrastructure/src/main/java/org/fuin/auction/infrastructure/InfrastructureStop.java InfrastructureStop] class when you're finished - If you use Eclipse you can use this [http://code.google.com/p/axon-auction-example/source/browse/trunk/auction-infrastructure/Stop+Auction+Infrastructure.launch launch configuration]

That's it for now...
